# Current State Report 2026-04-21

Historical snapshot only.

For the latest status after the Phase 0 primitive-freeze batch, see:

- [current-state-report-2026-04-22](./current-state-report-2026-04-22.md)

## Purpose

This report captures the repository's actual current state after the latest single-agent baseline strengthening cycle.

It records what is now true in code.
It is not a future-state architecture note.

## Current Stage

PFIOS is now clearly past the "single analyze workflow demo" stage.

The repository currently behaves as a single-agent controlled baseline with:

- bounded Hermes-backed analyze execution
- persisted workflow and intelligence runs
- centralized governance decision language
- minimal governance policy source
- execution request / receipt across recommendation, review, and validation action families
- single-owner success audit discipline on consolidated execution families
- explicit recovery policy object on the analyze workflow
- trace query paths that reach the review / outcome / feedback side of the chain
- harder persisted review-side trace relations for execution refs and feedback packet refs
- outcome backfill from review completion
- lesson extraction into derived knowledge entries
- derived knowledge feedback packets
- persisted knowledge feedback packet objects
- governance-side advisory hint consumption
- intelligence-side derived guidance consumption
- knowledge retrieval by recommendation, review, and symbol
- recurring issue aggregation over repeated lesson narratives
- review-facing and recommendation-facing truthful product surfaces
- expandable review detail surface on pending reviews
- textual trace detail surface
- minimum trust-tier / semantic discipline on active dashboard surfaces
- health monitoring snapshot over workflow, execution, and audit activity

This is still not:

- a full flywheel
- a policy-rewriting learning system
- a multi-agent system
- a complete execution platform

## Most Real Main Chain

The most real chain in the repository is now:

`analyze request -> workflow_run -> intelligence_run -> governance decision -> recommendation -> recommendation execution -> review submit -> review complete -> outcome snapshot -> lesson extraction -> knowledge feedback packet -> governance/intelligence hint consumption -> truthful surface`

What is real in this chain:

- Hermes-backed analyze execution
- persisted `WorkflowRun`
- persisted `IntelligenceRun`
- persisted `AgentAction`
- governance `execute / escalate / reject`
- policy source refs in governance payloads
- persisted `Recommendation`
- persisted request / receipt for:
  - `analysis_report_write`
  - `recommendation_generate`
  - `recommendation_status_update`
  - `review_submit`
  - `review_complete`
  - `validation_issue_report`
- single success audit ownership on the consolidated `recommendation_status_update` family path
- persisted `Review`
- persisted `OutcomeSnapshot`
- persisted `Lesson`
- derived `KnowledgeEntry`
- derived `KnowledgeFeedbackPacket`
- persisted knowledge feedback packet object
- governance advisory hint consumption
- intelligence guidance injection through `memory_lessons` and `related_reviews`
- knowledge retrieval by recommendation, review, and symbol
- recurring issue aggregation from repeated lesson-derived knowledge entries
- trace queries rooted from workflow, recommendation, and review
- direct review-side execution refs and feedback packet refs persisted on review truth
- review/recommendation dashboard surface with honest missing states
- health API monitoring snapshot with recent workflow failure, execution failure, and activity timestamps

What is not yet real:

- rule candidate promotion
- generalized cross-workflow recovery and fallback policy
- execution adapter registry / platform
- full-site truthful surface discipline
- monitoring history and runbook discipline

## Layer Reassessment

### Experience

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- recommendation and pending-review surfaces expose trace, outcome, and knowledge signals
- pending reviews now expose an expandable review detail view with execution refs and feedback packet signal
- textual trace detail is available through `TraceDetailPanel`
- trust-tier and semantic note discipline now exists for active dashboard surfaces

Still weak:

- there is still no standalone review detail page
- truthful surface discipline is not yet global

### Capability

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- core API routes continue to move through capability boundaries
- review and validation write paths now carry execution semantics through capability entrypoints

Still weak:

- compatibility facades still exist
- API boundary cleanup is not complete

### Orchestration

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- analyze is a formal workflow
- retry and compensation are explicit in parts of the analyze path
- analyze recovery is now driven by a formal recovery policy object
- workflow lineage is queryable

Still weak:

- fallback is still minimal
- recovery policy is still analyze-scoped rather than cross-workflow

### Governance

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- decision language is centralized
- active policy source is explicit
- policy refs now flow into analyze response, reports, audit payloads, and recommendation governance view
- governance can consume advisory hints from knowledge feedback

Still weak:

- policy source is still minimal and in-code
- not all governance paths are fully centralized

### Intelligence

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- Hermes runtime is integrated
- intelligence task contracts are bounded
- subsequent analyze runs can now consume derived guidance through existing task memory fields

Still weak:

- analyze remains the dominant real task family
- there is no broader task taxonomy or routing policy yet

### Execution

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- request / receipt now covers multiple real action families
- review family submit/complete now shares one adapter discipline
- validation issue reporting is now inside execution discipline

Still weak:

- adapter ownership is not fully consolidated across the whole layer
- registry/platform behavior does not yet exist

### State

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- main-chain fact objects are persisted
- trace query now reaches the review / outcome / feedback side of the chain
- recommendation, review, outcome, execution refs, and knowledge feedback signal can now be read together
- review-side execution refs and feedback packet refs now prefer persisted review relations before audit fallback

Still weak:

- full trace graph is still partial
- some relations still depend on audit refs instead of first-class foreign keys outside the hardened review-side path

### Knowledge

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- lessons can be extracted into knowledge entries
- knowledge feedback packets exist
- knowledge feedback packets are now persisted and queryable
- governance and intelligence now both consume derived hints
- retrieval now exists for recommendation, review, and symbol
- recurring issue aggregation now exists over repeated lesson-derived knowledge

Still weak:

- there is still no query API or user-facing knowledge surface
- recurring issues remain derived summaries, not rule candidates

### Infrastructure

Status: `In Progress`

Real now:

- startup, DB bootstrap, and minimum runtime health remain functional
- `/api/v1/health` now exposes monitoring snapshot fields from real workflow, execution, and audit objects
- the homepage status bar now reflects monitoring status and recent failure counts honestly

Still weak:

- monitoring history, runbook, and operations discipline are still weak

## Next Priority Direction

The next useful direction is no longer "prove the main chain exists."

The next useful direction is now:

1. `Execution | Adapter Registry / Platform`
2. `Experience | Global Trust-tier Rollout`
3. `Intelligence | Task Taxonomy Expansion`

At the architecture level, the next framing move is also clear:

- keep the current nine-surface responsibility model
- begin classifying the repo into:
  - stable `core` primitives
  - `finance pack` domain implementations
  - replaceable `adapters`

That does **not** mean the repository should be rewritten into new top-level folders immediately.

It means the next platformization work should first freeze primitives and classify current code before attempting large directory moves.

See:

- [Core / Pack / Adapter Baseline](./core-pack-adapter-baseline.md)
- [Current Code Classification Map v1](./current-code-classification-map-v1.md)
- [Finance Pack v1 Definition](./finance-pack-v1-definition.md)
- [Core Primitives Spec v1](./core-primitives-spec-v1.md)
- [Adapter Boundary Spec v1](./adapter-boundary-spec-v1.md)

## Final Judgment

PFIOS is now a single-agent baseline system with real:

- truth objects
- governance language
- policy source refs
- execution receipts across multiple families
- family-level single-owner success audit discipline on consolidated paths
- formal recovery policy on the analyze workflow
- trace query paths across the main chain and review chain
- harder persisted review-side trace relations
- outcome backfill
- derived knowledge
- persisted feedback packets
- retrieval and recurring issue aggregation
- governance and intelligence feedback consumption
- health monitoring snapshot over workflow, execution, and audit activity
- truthful product surfaces on key active views
- expandable review detail surface on pending reviews

It is still not a full learning flywheel and not a multi-agent organization.

The system is currently strongest in:

- State
- Governance
- analyze-centered Orchestration
- execution family hardening

The system is currently weakest in:

- knowledge retrieval and aggregation
- cross-workflow recovery and fallback formalization
- full-surface product truthfulness
- infrastructure discipline
