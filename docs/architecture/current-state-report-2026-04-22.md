# Current State Report 2026-04-22

## Purpose

This report captures the repository state after the Phase 1 core load-bearing batch for `AegisOS / CAIOS`.

It records what is now true in code after:

- `Phase 0 | Freeze Core Primitives`
- `Phase 1 | Strengthen Core Load-Bearing Behavior`

## Current Stage

The repository is now in a materially stronger pre-pack-extraction state:

- the single-agent main chain is still real
- core/pack/adapter framing is documented
- Phase 0 primitives are frozen in code
- Phase 1 turns those primitives into reusable behavior-level contracts

That means the system is no longer only "main-chain proven" or "primitive-frozen."

It is now also:

- policy-read centralized on the analyze path
- approval-aware on a consequential action family
- runtime-interface aware rather than Hermes-body aware
- registry-driven on key execution families
- graph/query-strengthened on trace/outcome/checkpoint semantics
- auditable on downstream feedback consumption

## What Became Newly Real In Phase 1

### Governance

- `GovernancePolicySource` is now the approved policy-read entrypoint for analyze-path governance reads.
- governance hint consumption is now formalized as an explicit advisory-only consumer contract.
- `ApprovalRecord` and `HumanApprovalGate` now exist.
- `review_complete` can now be blocked until approval is present.

### Intelligence

- orchestration/runtime callers now target `AgentRuntime`.
- Hermes remains the only runtime implementation, but no longer defines system meaning.
- `MemoryPolicy` now explicitly gates feedback-hint injection.
- `HintAwareContextBuilder` now formalizes analyze hint injection.

### Execution

- review and validation families now participate in a shared execution adapter registry contract.
- `ExecutionAdapterRegistry` now exists.
- `ExecutionProgressRecord` now exists for progress/heartbeat observations on execution requests.
- the analyze/recommendation path is the first live path using this stronger execution contract.

### State

- `TraceGraph` now exists as the clearer graph/query contract over the existing trace path.
- `OutcomeGraph` now formalizes recommendation -> review -> outcome traversal.
- `CheckpointState` now stabilizes:
  - `blocked_reason`
  - `wake_reason`
  - `resume_marker`
- `WorkflowRun.lineage_refs` remains the persistence anchor in this phase.

### Knowledge

- feedback generation and feedback consumption are now separate concerns.
- `FeedbackRecord` now records downstream consumption of persisted feedback packets.
- recurring issue aggregation is now formalized as a first-class contract.
- `CandidateRule` now exists as a non-active pre-policy object.

## Main Chain

The most real chain is now:

`analyze request -> workflow_run -> intelligence_run -> governance decision -> recommendation -> recommendation execution -> review submit -> review complete -> outcome snapshot -> knowledge feedback packet -> governance/intelligence feedback consumption record -> truthful surface`

What changed in Phase 1 is not the existence of the chain, but the strength of the contracts that carry it.

## What Is Still Not Real

This repository still does **not** yet have:

- a full supervisor workspace beyond the current reviews console
- a broader tabbed workspace beyond the current review-console-local shell
- wake/resume execution behavior
- handoff artifact-driven long-running orchestration
- scheduler-backed periodic business work beyond low-risk triggers
- full monitoring history / runbook discipline
- physical finance-pack extraction
- physical Hermes runtime adapter relocation

Those now belong to the next phase.

## Completed Through 2026-04-22

### Completed on 2026-04-22

- `Cross-layer | Phase 0 Core Primitive Freeze`
  - `DecisionLanguage`
  - `ActionRequest / ActionReceipt`
  - `Outcome`
  - `FeedbackPacket`
  - `TraceLink`
  - `Task / Run`
  - `AgentRuntime`
  - `MemoryPolicy`
- `Cross-layer | Phase 1 Core Load-Bearing Batch`
  - `GovernancePolicySource` deepening
  - `FeedbackHintConsumer`
  - `HumanApprovalGate`
  - `HintAwareContextBuilder`
  - `ExecutionAdapterRegistry`
  - `Progress / Heartbeat`
  - `TraceGraph`
  - `OutcomeGraph`
  - `CheckpointState`
  - `FeedbackRecord`
  - `RecurringIssueAggregator` formalization
  - `CandidateRule`

### Previously Completed

See:

- [current-state-report-2026-04-21](./current-state-report-2026-04-21.md)

That report still holds for the main-chain strengthening work completed before the Phase 0 and Phase 1 batch completion.

## Next Priority Direction

The next correct batch is no longer primitive freeze or core load-bearing strengthening.

That next batch has now been completed as a serial 8-module wave.

## What Became Newly Real After Phase 1

- `packs/finance/` now exists in planning form with explicit extraction inventory.
- `adapters/runtimes/hermes/` now exists and the old provider path is a shim over it.
- analyze workflow can now emit formal handoff refs and honest degraded fallback after retry exhaustion.
- wake/resume metadata now persists through workflow lineage refs.
- `infra/scheduler/` now exists for low-risk scheduled dispatch.
- monitoring now exposes minimal history summary, not only a point-in-time snapshot.
- runbooks now cover:
  - blocked review
  - runtime unhealthy
  - trace inconsistency
- shared `TrustTier` semantics now back key review/recommendation/trace surfaces.
- `/reviews` now exists as a dedicated review supervision route.
- a minimal object-tab workspace now exists for review/trace-oriented views.
- finance analysis context ownership has started to move into `packs/finance`, with orchestration paths kept as shims.
- Hermes runtime resolution now points directly at the adapter layer, with the old provider path left as compatibility-only shim.
- scheduler now has low-risk file persistence and enabled-trigger batch dispatch.
- monitoring history now exposes top failure summaries and blocked run ids through health.
- review workspace tabs now render linked recommendation content and can seed initial review state from route input.
- finance analyze default ownership has moved one step further into `packs/finance/analyze_defaults.py`, so capability no longer hard-codes finance defaults directly.

The correct reading is:

- Phase 0 froze meaning
- Phase 1 strengthened behavior
- the post-Phase-1 serial batch strengthened supervision, long-running control, and explicit pack/adapter separation
- the next phase should deepen extraction, scheduler persistence, and broader workspace behavior
